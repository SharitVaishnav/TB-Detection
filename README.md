This project presents an **Explainable AI (XAI)**-driven approach to detect **tuberculosis (TB)** from chest X-ray (CXR) images using deep learning architectures including **DenseNet, WideResNet, AlexNet**, and **LeNet**. It also integrates **Grad-CAM** and **LIME** to explain model predictions, enhancing clinical trust and transparency.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Models Used:** DenseNet, LeNet-5, AlexNet, WideResNet
- 🏥 **Data:** Publicly available TB CXR dataset curated with 1,500 TB-positive and 1,500 normal images (after augmentation)
- 🎯 **Accuracy Achieved:**
  - DenseNet: 99.5%
  - WideResNet: 96.8%
  - LeNet: 97.5%
  - AlexNet: 91.8%
- 🧪 **Explainability:** Used Grad-CAM and LIME to visualize infected lung regions and interpret CNN decisions
- 🖥️ **Environment:** Google Colab (T4 GPU), TensorFlow, Keras

---

## 📁 Dataset

A curated, balanced subset from the open-source CXR TB dataset, preprocessed as follows:

- Resized to 256×256
- Grayscale normalization
- Data augmentation (flipping, rotation) to mitigate class imbalance

---

## ⚙️ Model Architectures

- **DenseNet:** Dense connections for efficient feature reuse
- **WideResNet:** Deeper + wider architecture with residual learning
- **AlexNet:** Pioneering deep CNN with multiple conv+FC layers
- **LeNet-5:** Lightweight, early CNN ideal for mobile deployments

---

## 🔍 Explainability Techniques

- **Grad-CAM:** Highlights regions influencing prediction by visualizing class-specific activation maps.
- **LIME:** Perturbs image regions to determine local feature importance and decision boundary.
